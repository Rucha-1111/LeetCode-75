## Problem Statement

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `i`th kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.  

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `i`th kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.  

> Note: Multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: candies = `[2,3,5,1,3]`, extraCandies = 3

Output: `[true,true,true,false,true]`

Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

**Example 2:**

Input: candies = `[4,2,1,1,2]`, extraCandies = 1

Output: `[true,false,false,false,false]`

Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

**Example 3:**
Input: candies = `[12,1,12]`, extraCandies = 10

Output: `[true,false,true]`

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        int maxCandies = candies[0];
        for(int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
            if (candies[i] > maxCandies) {
                maxCandies = candies[i];
            }
        }

        for (int candy : candies) {
            ans.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
        }
        return ans;
    }    
}

```

## Understanding The Approach: 
Before we understand the approach, let us first look into *what are *__lists__*?* In **Java**, a list is an `interface` that represents an ordered collection(or a sequence) of elements, which allows for duplicates and null values, making it a core of **Java Collections Frameworks**, allowing us to store and manage a dynamic number of objects. 

The reason we used `Lists` is to store an array of boolean values for a dynamic array, where we would not have to define the size of the array before. 

- ```java List<Boolean> ans = new ArrayList<>();``` creates a list to store the result (true or false) for each kid.
- We define a ```java int maxCandies = candies[0];``` to assume the value of maximum candies to that of the first kid.
- ```java
  for(int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
    if (candies[i] > maxCandies) {
      maxCandies = candies[i];
    }
  }
  ```
  We start the loop through all the kids, comparing the candies of the `current kid (candies[i])` to the value in the `maxCandies`. If the candies of the current kid are more than the value in the maxCandies, then the maxCandies' value is updated.
- ```java
  for (int candy : candies) {
    ans.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
  }
  return ans;
  ```
  We start a second loop to check which kid has greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies amongst all the kids, which is stored in `maxCandies` variable.
- If the kid has more number of candies after being given the extra candies, then the value added to the list is `True`, else the value is `False`.
- After the loop is over, we simply return the result stored in the `ans` variable. 

---

## Time Complexity
- The first loop iterates through the `candies` array to find the maximum value, which takes **O(n)** time.
- The second loop checks each kid’s candies after adding `extraCandies`, which also takes **O(n)** time.
- Since the loops run sequentially, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

## Space Complexity
- A `List<Boolean>` is used to store the result for each kid, which requires **O(n)** extra space.
- Apart from the result list, only a few variables are used, which take **O(1)** space.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(n)**.

---

## Key Takeaways 
- We break the problem in two parts - first we calculate the maximum value from the array, and then we check whether each element plus `extraCandies` meets or exceeds this maximum.
- A `List` is being used because the result size is dynamic.
- The original `candies` array is never modified; all checks are done using comparisons.
- The solution relies on comparison logic rather than sorting, which keeps the time complexity low.
- The method returns results in the same order as the input array.
